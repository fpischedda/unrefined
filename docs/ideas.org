* Build a browser extension that can

- Start new refinement session
  
  - if on a recognizable ticket page start from there
  - otherwise start from scratch requesting a ticket id or URL

- After starting a new session then the ticket URL is automatically copied to the clipboard
  - The link is then shared with other peeps
  - When loading the page
    - if the person has the plugin installed then redirect the current browser to the ticket URL
    - otherwise the usual workflow should be shown
      
- The plugin should subscribe to refinements events and 
  - Show a sorts of estimation view with the breakdown
    - If the ticket gets re-estimated than reset the estimation view
  - Redirect to new tickets when the current ticket changes
